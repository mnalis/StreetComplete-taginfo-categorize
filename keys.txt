## StreetComplete now automagically removes matching source:$key (and check_date:$key); see https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/6057
## so our Makefile will invoke generate_kotlin.pl in such a way that those are no longer included in sc_to_remove.txt, even when they are listed here (where they need to remain to be detected by "make ## update")
## Also they might be useful to other potential consumers of this data (who may be interested in those more popular source:$key and check_data:$key tags) who might want to invoke generate_kotlin.pl without skipping them.
