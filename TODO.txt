- script to convert only "### KEYS TO REMOVE ###" from keys.txt into SC Kotlin format
- print STDERR statistics (tags to keep, tags to remove)
- also do for other keys, not just "shop=" (see ticket #3244 and source)
- need to keep: 'barrier' and similar; are they added? see https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/pull/3045#issuecomment-887663272
- script to detect duplicates in keys.txt (eg. note:* and note:en)
- Makefile: unify fetching *.JSON - just specify max_entities/key/(optional)value and have unifed way to fetch and process all of them
- add also minimum limit of tags? No sense for wading through tags is it is used only 50 times worldwide (usually in one place, too)

- watch for this tags too:
fun isKindOfShopExpression(prefix: String? = null): String {
    val p = if(prefix != null) "$prefix:" else ""
    return ("""
        or ${p}tourism = information and ${p}information = office
        or """ +
        mapOf(
            "amenity" to arrayOf(
                "restaurant", "cafe", "ice_cream", "fast_food", "bar", "pub", "biergarten", "nightclub",

}
